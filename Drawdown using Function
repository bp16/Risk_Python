## Same as drawdown code but this one uses function to keep it cleaner and easier
## Input file etc are same as drawdown code

# Writing the function
def drawdown(return_series: pd.Series):
    """
    Takes a timeseries of asset returns
    Computes and returns DataFrame that contains
    Wealth Index
    Previous Peaks
    Percentage Drawdowns
    """
    wealth_index = 100 * (1+ return_series).cumprod()
    previous_peaks = wealth_index.cummax()
    draw = (wealth_index - previous_peaks)/ previous_peaks
    return pd.DataFrame({
        "Wealth": wealth_index,
        "Peaks" : previous_peaks,
        "Drawdowns": draw
    })

# Using the function
drawdown(rets["Port5"]).head() ## Column name is from the input file that contains date and return (Port5) as %

#Plotting
drawdown(rets['Port5'])[["Wealth","Peaks"]].plot()

# doing it from specific date say 2000 till end
drawdown(rets["2000":]['Port5'])[["Wealth","Peaks"]].plot()
