## Compute Drawdown

### 1. Compute wealth index
### 2. Compute previous peaks
### 3. Compute Drawdowns = wealth value as % of previous peaks

## Growth of 100
wealth_index = 100*(1+rets['Port5']).cumprod()
wealth_index.plot.line()

# Compute previous peaks. Go over time but keep track of max value
previous_peaks = wealth_index.cummax()

#This line never goes down as it tracks the max at any point in time
previous_peaks.plot.line()

#Drawdown in %
drawdown = (wealth_index - previous_peaks)/ previous_peaks
drawdown.plot()

# How much was the biggest drawdown
drawdown.min()

# When did this happen i.e. index data of biggest drawdown
drawdown.idxmin()
